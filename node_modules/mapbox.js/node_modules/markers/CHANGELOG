### 0.14.5

* Fixes for IE9 and IE10.

### 0.14.4

* Fix bug where tooltip events would propogate to map

### 0.14.3

* Fixes use case for changing the value of `showOnHover` after tooltips
  have already been attached.
* Adds .add() and .remove() methods to quickly enable and disable interaction.
* Documents .markers() and adds programmatic access to `.showTooltip()`
  per-marker - as well as access to `.tooltip` for markers with tooltips.

### 0.14.2

* Fixes code around bindPanned that was breaking hideOnMove functionality.

### 0.14.1

* Documentation improvements

### 0.14.0

* Documentation improvements

### 0.13.0

* what used to be `id` - the getter for optimizing moving markers - is now `key`
* `id` now behaves the same as `mapbox.layer().id()` - you can specify a
  MapBox layer ID.

### 0.12.0

* Documentation improvements

### 0.11.0

* `hide_on_move` is now `hideOnMove` and `show_on_hover` is now `showOnHover`,
  to @tmcw's chagrin.

### 0.10.0

* Adds an `.id(idfn)` interface that allows for higher performance
  for moving markers
* The callback to `.url()` now takes `(err, features)` instead of
  just `(features)`

### 0.9.0

* Allows markers to be named with the `.named([value])`
  interface, sets default name to 'markers'

### 0.8.0

* Adds `layer.csv(csvText)` interface, removes
  mapbox.markers.csv_url_to_geojson interface.

### 0.7.2

* Updates `simplestyle_factory` Retina URLs to have the `@2x` indicator
  within the filename, not at its end.

### 0.7.0

* Yet again renames things quite a bit, get out your text editors:

    mapbox.markers - mapbox.markers.layer
    mapbox.markers_interaction - mapbox.markers.interaction

### 0.6.0

* Removing version-prefixed builds. Either use `/dist/markers.min.js`
  or use `mapbox.js` for versioning.
* API restructuring:


    mapbox.markers_interaction - mapbox.markers.interaction
	mapbox.csv_to_geojson - mapbox.markers.csv_to_geojson
	mapbox.csv_url_to_geojson - mapbox.markers.csv_url_to_geojson


### 0.5.3

* Allows for interaction to be assigned to markers in multiple
  layers. This means that users _must_ assign `.style.pointerEvents = 'all'`
  in custom factories. It's done by default in the default factory.
* Sets `simplestyle_factory` to be the default factory.

### 0.5.2

* Changes some style naming:


	wax-movetip - map-tooltip
	wax-intip - marker-popup
	mmg-title - marker-title
	mmg-description - marker-description

### 0.5.1

* Fixed an error in which using array syntax instead of
  `.charAt()` resulted in all simplestyle markers for IE being 404s.

### 0.5.0

* Adds `.filter()` method which allows the filtering of points
  to be displayed without changing the underlying features array.
* `mmg` is now renamed `markers` and will be renamed in code
  at 1.0.0

### 0.4.0

* Adds mmg_csv to core.
* Fixes potential problems around the creation of the `parent`
  element.

### 0.3.1

* Fixes error around last refactoring in which tooltips themselves
  were interactive and caused an error trying to recursively pop up
  more tooltips

### 0.3.0

* Refactors `mmg_interaction` to be usable without having the mmg layer
  attached to the map.
* Via that refactor, the `mmg` object now has `addCallback` and
  `removeCallback` functions for adding callbacks for the `drawn` and
  `markeradded` events.

### 0.2.5

* Uses images instead of divs and sprites for markers in order to make them printable
* Updates dependency modestmaps to add touch compatibility

### 0.2.4

* Align tooltips' bottoms to their markers' tops. Handles resizable tooltips.

### 0.2.3

* Removed indexOf shim. no functional change.

### 0.2.2

* Adds index.js to make node.js happy
* Adds .baseurl passthrough for HTTPS corner cases in simplestyle_factory

### 0.2.1

* Fixed a bug that resulted in new tooltips being immediately closed
  when a user quickly jumps from point to point and has both exclusive
  tooltips and show on hover enabled.
